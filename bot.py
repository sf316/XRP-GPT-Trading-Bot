    Assuming I have a {trading_goals['risk_tolerance']} risk tolerance and am looking to engage in {trading_goals['trading_timeframe']} trades on the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange, here's the latest market data I've gathered: {json.dumps(market_data, indent=2)}. I'm interested in a trading strategy that balances potential profits with risk management. Could you outline a trading strategy that takes into account current market trends, historical price action, and overall crypto market sentiment?
