# XRP GPT Trading Bot

## Inspiration

I was inspired by the potential of generative AI to analyze vast amounts of financial data and provide actionable insights, which could democratize high-level trading strategies for individual investors. Recognizing the gap between complex trading algorithms and the everyday trader's tools, I set out to create a solution that leverages AI to make informed trading decisions accessible to all.

## What it does

This project acts as a bridge between the world of cryptocurrency trading and AI-powered decision-making in real-time.

## Challenges I ran into

In the current design of the XRP Ledger, I must provide the addresses of the issuers of counterparties to extract all open book orders, which limits my access to data for exploring better trading strategies.

## What's next for XRP GPT Trading Bot

- [ ] Complete the front-end design to enable user interaction with the trading bot.
- [ ] Acquire additional market data from more credible sources and add parameters to further tailor to user preferences.
- [ ] Expand the strategy scope to encompass more than two assets.
